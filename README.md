# power consumption analysis 
# OVERVIEW 
I analyze this power bi dashboard and provide insight into power consumption trends across diffrent zones and enviromental factors ,the analysis also highlights sesonal variations in humidity ,temprature and wind speed.

# INSIGHT
1. Month by total power consumption we recorded the highest power consumption in july with 393,606kwh
2. power consumption by all zones ,zone 1 recorded the highest power consumption in july with 393,606kwh
3. We recorded the highest humidity in qtr1 ,highest diffuse in qtr2, highest temprature in qtr3 , and highest windspeed in qtr3
4. KPI visulization 275.40M
5. target 96.62k(-284964)
6. we recorded the highest average power consumption in july 88kwh and power consumption variance in august with 35k
7. Thursday has the highest power consumption with 73k kwh

# RECOMMENDATION 
1. investigate the reson behind the spike in power consumption
2. encourage energy efficient pratrice such as using smart meters to alert user of high consumption period or ofeer incentives for off peak usage
3. ensuring infasture can handle high load of peak in peak month
4. conduct zone specific energy audit to identify high consumption appliances ,processesor behaviour contributing to spike in zone 1
5. promoting renewable energy solutions by installing solar panels or other renewable sources in high consumption zones to offset demand
6. introdue targeted programs such as energy savings campaigns or smart grid technologies to manage zone 1 high demands
7. humidty(q1)install dehumidifier or energy efficient cooling system to reduce impact of humidy on power consumption
9. diffuse energy (q2) use this quater quater high diffuse energy for solar energy harvsting ,increasing renewable usage
10. temprature and wind (q3) optimize HVAC systems for efficient and leveraging and turbines if feasible in Q3 to supplement power supply
